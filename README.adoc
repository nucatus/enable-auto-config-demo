= Spring Boot EnableAutoConfiguration bug

Application used for reproducing the `EnableAutoConfiguration` issue where the annotation that
is applied to the parent class is missed, although it has the `@Inherited` meta annotation.

In this particular case, we define a parent class to set all the abstract configuration. Child test
classes will extend this master class and, supposedly, the parent class configuration will be
inherited.
